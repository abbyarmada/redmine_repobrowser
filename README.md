== Repository browser, a Remine plugin


=== Short Description
This plugin adds a new button to the wiki editor.
When clicked, a popup dialog with the directory structure of the projects repository is shown and can be browsed.
Once you found the file you where looking for, a link (source:path/filename) is added into the editor textform.

=== Installation
As usual, copy the redmine_repobrowser directory to redmine/plugins.
